# Backlog

Ideas and enhancements. Priorities: **high** = next, **med** = soon, **low** = nice-to-have.

---

## v1 follow-ups (data completeness)

- ~~**[high] Expand beyond top-100.**~~ Done 2026-04-27 — all 1,908 unique NPL sites now load (~1.6MB JSON, ~200KB gzipped). Connector handles pagination through the FeatureServer's 2000-record cap.
- ~~**[high] Sites without acreage.**~~ Done 2026-04-27 — `--include-no-acreage` (default on) keeps non-areal features with `acreage: null`. Frontend renders "N/A" and uses a small marker.
- **[high] EPA Brownfields (ACRES).** ~40k sites from EPA's Assessment, Cleanup and Redevelopment Exchange System. Distinct from Superfund — usually smaller, urban, and further along in cleanup. Pull from Envirofacts (table names: `BF_ASSESSMENT_PROPERTY`, `BF_CLEANUP_PROPERTY`) or the public ACRES export. Connector framework is in place — drop a new file in `connectors/` and register.
- **[med] State environmental agency sites.** Each state has its own brownfield/voluntary cleanup program (NY State Superfund, CA DTSC EnviroStor, TX VCP, etc.). Now trivial to aggregate — one connector per source.
- **[med] RCRA Corrective Action sites.** EPA Resource Conservation and Recovery Act sites under corrective action — another large universe of contaminated industrial properties.
- **[low] DOD FUDS (Formerly Used Defense Sites).** USACE-administered. Big, often rural, sometimes acquirable.
- **[med] State-sharded JSON.** Defer until EPA Brownfields (~40k) lands. At that scale the single sites.json approaches a megabyte gzipped and is worth sharding by state for lazy load.

## Site-level enrichment (Owner / encumbrances / history)

- **[high] Current owner.** Not in EPA data. Source options:
  - County recorder offices (per-county scraping; messy, no standard schema)
  - **ReportAll USA / Regrid / Loveland Tech** — paid parcel APIs covering ~3,000 US counties
  - State assessor open data (varies wildly)
  - Strategy: start with a single high-value state (e.g. NJ — has a free statewide parcel layer)
- **[high] Historical owners.** County deed history. Same access constraints as above; some title-search vendors expose APIs.
- **[high] Encumbrances.** Liens, easements, environmental covenants (institutional controls). EPA's *Superfund Institutional Controls Tracking System (ICTS)* publishes some of this; needs investigation.
- **[med] Remediation detail.** Current site only carries NPL status code. Add: Record of Decision (ROD) summary, current cleanup phase, remedy type, lead party (PRP/EPA/state), Five-Year Review status. EPA SEMS has these in adjacent tables.
- **[low] Site-specific contamination profile.** Contaminants of concern, media affected (groundwater/soil/sediment), exposure pathways. SEMS has it.

## Infrastructure proximity (the data-center thesis)

All deferred from v1. Compute at refresh time, bake into JSON.

- **[high] Transmission lines + substations.** [HIFLD Open](https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/) Electric Power Transmission Lines + Electric Substations layers. Nearest-neighbor distance via shapely + rtree.
- **[high] Available transmission capacity.** Going beyond "is there a wire nearby" — **FERC Form 715 / OASIS / regional ISO interconnection queue position**. This is the actual gating factor for data-center siting; hyperscalers care about MW available, not line count.
- **[high] Major roads + interstate access.** HIFLD Primary Roads. Nearest-distance + drive-time from nearest interstate exit.
- **[high] Rail.** HIFLD North American Rail Network. Distance to nearest active line + classification (Class I/II/III).
- **[med] Water.** USGS NHD HighRes + waterbodies. Compute distance to: nearest surface water (cooling), nearest municipal water service area.
- **[med] Fiber proximity.** Genuine pain point — no clean public dataset.
  - FCC National Broadband Map (block-level fiber availability, indirect)
  - Crown Castle / Zayo / Lumen public route maps (PDFs, no APIs)
  - State broadband office GIS layers (varies)
  - **Best near-term proxy:** distance to nearest long-haul fiber landing point + presence of a colocation facility within 50mi (Data Center Map, paid).
- **[med] Natural gas pipelines.** HIFLD Natural Gas Pipelines. Relevant for behind-the-meter generation.
- **[med] Airport proximity.** HIFLD Aviation Facilities — for site-as-cargo-hub use cases.

## Data Center Opportunity Dashboard (pivot)

Turn this into a "Where can I site a hyperscale data center on a remediated brownfield?" tool. The angle: **post-remediation industrial land with grid + water + fiber that's already zoned heavy industrial is gold for AI buildouts, and Superfund/brownfield inventories are an under-mined source.**

- **[high] Data-center scoring model.** Weighted score per site:
  - Acreage ≥ X (configurable; default 50ac for hyperscale, 5ac for edge)
  - Remediation status (Deleted from NPL = green, on Final NPL = yellow, no SI/RI = red)
  - MW of available transmission capacity within 5mi
  - Surface-water cooling potential
  - Fiber-route proximity
  - Power cost ($/MWh) by utility territory
  - Climate suitability (cooling-degree-days, freshwater stress index)
- **[high] Filter UI for siting personas.** Toggle presets: "Hyperscale (≥100 ac)", "Inference edge (≥5 ac, <50ms to top-20 metro)", "Crypto/HPC (cheap power, remote OK)".
- **[high] Power-cost overlay.** EIA Form 861 retail rates by utility, joined to service-territory polygons.
- **[high] ISO interconnection-queue proximity.** PJM/MISO/CAISO/ERCOT/SPP/NYISO/ISO-NE queues are public; distance to nearest **active queued generation project** is a leading indicator of available capacity.
- **[med] Tax incentive layer.** Opportunity Zones (Treasury), state brownfield tax credits, federal Brownfield Tax Incentive (where still active), data-center-specific state programs (VA, AZ, GA, IA exemptions).
- **[med] Zoning overlay.** Most counties don't publish machine-readable zoning. Aggregate where available; flag manual-check-needed where not.
- **[med] Water rights & municipal capacity.** Western US: water rights are often the binding constraint, not power. Surface a per-site "water available?" field.
- **[med] PRP (Potentially Responsible Party) status.** A site with cleanup costs already settled or a willing PRP is dramatically more transactable than one with open litigation. EPA tracks PRP status in SEMS.
- **[low] Comparable transactions feed.** Recent brownfield-to-DC conversions (e.g. AWS at the old Talen Energy site, Meta's various Steel Belt redevelopments). Manually curated case-study list.
- **[low] Outreach contact card.** Per site: PRP counsel, regional EPA project manager, state brownfield program lead. Click-to-email templates.
- **[low] Timeline-to-shovel-ready.** Estimated months from "site identified" to "ready for vertical construction" given current remediation phase. Useful for capital planning.

## Frontend / UX

- **[high] Polygon overlays on map.** Currently we flatten polygons to a centroid marker. Render the actual site boundary on zoom-in. Now even more useful since multi-polygon sites (Portland Harbor's 100 fragments) get merged for marker placement but the source rings are dropped — would need to keep them on disk.
- **[high] Surface dedupe / parent-child relationships in UI.** `parent_epa_id` is now populated for status-A sub-sites we drop, but the frontend doesn't show "this site has N sub-sites" or let the user expand to see them.
- **[med] State filter, status filter, acreage range slider.** Faceted filtering on both map and table. Pairs naturally with the existing search box.
- ~~**[med] Search box.**~~ Done 2026-04-27 — free-text on name / city / county / state, filters both table and markers, ESC to clear.
- **[med] URL state sharing.** `?site=<EPA_ID>` deep-links to a specific site's detail panel. `?q=<search>` for the filter query.
- **[med] CSV export.** "Download filtered set as CSV" button on the table.
- **[low] Print/PDF site card.** For pitch decks.
- **[low] Theme toggle.** Currently light-only (was dark-only, swapped 2026-04-27). Add a toggle + persist in `localStorage` if anyone misses dark.
- **[low] Single source of truth for status colors.** NPL status colors are duplicated across `colorForStatus()` (app.js), the `STATUS_LEGEND` array (app.js), the `--status-*` CSS variables, and the `.pill[data-status]` rules (style.css). Centralize — e.g. emit CSS vars from JS at boot, or generate the pill rules from the same constant.
- **[low] Polygon mask for non-US areas.** `maxBounds` + `minZoom` keep the user inside US-only territory, but at the edges Mexico/Canada/Cuba tiles are still visible. A US outline polygon overlay (filled with the page bg) would fully blank them out. Tradeoff: +1 fetch (~30–60KB simplified outline) and a polygon-render cost on every pan/zoom.

## Performance / hosting

- **[med] Tile self-hosting.** OSM tile policy discourages heavy production use. If the dashboard gets traffic, switch to a free vector-tile provider (Protomaps + free tiles, or MapTiler free tier).
- **[med] State-sharded JSON.** When the dataset grows past ~500 sites, shard `sites.json` by state and lazy-load on map pan.
- **[low] PWA / offline cache.** Service worker for repeat visits.

## Engineering hygiene

- ~~**[high] Tests for refresh.py.**~~ Done 2026-04-27 — pytest suite covers normalize/envelope/fetch/dedupe/merge/diff/schema (~57 unit tests).
- ~~**[high] Frontend smoke test (Playwright or similar).**~~ Done 2026-04-27 — `tests/e2e/test_smoke.py` covers page load, tab switch, marker click, table click, Esc close, search filtering, legend render. Runs in CI on every PR.
- **[med] Marker clustering or spatial decimation at low zoom.** Canvas markers handle 1.9k fine; once Brownfields/ACRES (~40k) lands, re-introduce `leaflet.markercluster` (with proper SRI hashes) or add zoom-based decimation.
- ~~**[high] Resolve dual-deploy ambiguity.**~~ Done 2026-04-27 — pushed `deploy.yml` + `refresh.yml`, switched Pages source to GitHub Actions via `gh api PUT pages -f build_type=workflow`. README and issues.md updated.
- ~~**[med] Move `docs/serve.py` out of `docs/`.**~~ Done 2026-04-27 — moved to `scripts/serve.py`; chdirs to docs/ so still runs from repo root.
- ~~**[med] Schema validation.**~~ Done 2026-04-27 — Pydantic `Payload`/`SiteRecord` in `schema.py` with `extra="forbid"`. `refresh.py` validates before write.
- ~~**[med] Diff log.**~~ Done 2026-04-27 — `diff.py` writes `data/changes.md`; `refresh.yml` parses summary into commit message.
- ~~**[med] Defensive over-fetch guard.**~~ Done 2026-04-27 — connector logs a warning if >50% of fetched features drop during normalize.

## Data quality (deferred normalizations)

- ~~**[med] Decode `FEDERAL_FACILITY_DETER_CODE`.**~~ Done 2026-04-27 — pulled from layer metadata at refresh time alongside `NPL_STATUS_CODE`.
- ~~**[med] Dedupe / nest parent-child NPL sites.**~~ Done 2026-04-27 — status-A sub-sites whose name matches a parent's prefix are dropped from the main list and tagged with `parent_epa_id`. Orphans kept. UI doesn't yet show the parent→children relationship (separate backlog item under Frontend/UX).
- ~~**[med] Fallback EPA site-profile URL.**~~ Done 2026-04-27 — falls back to `cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/CurSites/csitinfo.cfm?id=<EPA_ID>` when both source fields are null.
- ~~**[low] Cosmetic acreage formatting.**~~ Done 2026-04-27 — `fmt.acres()` now uses thousands separators everywhere and hides trailing `.0`.
- **[med] Multi-polygon merge surfacing.** `_merge_by_epa_id()` collapses fragmented sites (e.g. Portland Harbor) into one record, but the source rings are dropped — when polygon overlays land, we'll need to keep the per-fragment geometry on disk.
